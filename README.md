# Crack Detection and Quantification using Swarm Drone Technology

## Swarm Drones

Swarm drones, also known as drone swarms or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms, refer to a collection of multiple drones operating collaboratively as a single, cohesive unit. Inspired by natural phenomena like bird flocks, ant colonies, or fish schools, these systems mimic decentralized intelligence where individual drones communicate and coordinate in real-time to achieve complex tasks that would be inefficient or impossible for a single drone. Unlike traditional single-drone operations, swarm drones emphasize scalability, redundancy, and emergent behavior—where simple rules followed by each drone lead to sophisticated group-level outcomes.
The concept gained traction in the early 2010s, but roots trace back to military research in the 1990s. Today, with advancements in AI, edge computing, and 5G/6G networks, swarm drones are transitioning from labs to real-world applications.
